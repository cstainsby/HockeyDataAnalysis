    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "[link](http://inalitic.com/datasets/nhl_leaguestandings_data.html) to initial dataset\n",
    "For the initial part of our project, we will be predicting whether a team will make it into the playoffs. \n",
    "### Format and Contents of Data\n",
    "In Order data is \n",
    "- SEASON(int - year) \t\n",
    "- CONFERENCE(str - name)\n",
    "- DIVISION(str - name)\n",
    "- TEAM(str - name)\n",
    "- TM(str - name) \n",
    "- PLAYOFFS(char - Y/N)\n",
    "- GP(int)\n",
    "- W(int - wins)\n",
    "- L(int - losses)\n",
    "- T(int - ties)\n",
    "- OL(int - games lost in overtime)\n",
    "- PTS(int - number of points)\n",
    "- PTS%(double - num points/num shots)\n",
    "- GF(int - goals for)\n",
    "- GA(int - goals against)\n",
    "- SRS(double - Goals scored by player while team is on the powerplay. First recorded in the 1968 season.)\n",
    "- SOS(double - Goals scored by player while team is on the penalty kill (shorthanded). First recorded in the 1968 season.)\n",
    "- RPT%(double - Game winning goals scored by player in that season. First recorded in the 1968 season.)\n",
    "- ROW(double - Assists tallied by player while team is even strength. First recorded in the 1968 season.)\n",

    "### Brief Description Of Attributes and Class Info\n",
    "The class attribute we will use from this data is the Playoffs attribute given that this is a binary Y/N classification. \n",
    "The rest of the attributes will be used in the training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "Given that this initial dataset is pretty straightforward, once we have finished creating a model for it we will attempt to create another model to predict who wins each of the tournament games using [this](https://moneypuck.com/data.htm) dataset. Additional documentation will be written as we advance and add more complexity \n",

    "## Implementation and Technical Merit\n",
    "1. Anticipated challenges in pre-processing and/or classification\n",
    "    Some issues with this dataset may be utilizing the data from this and the actual accuracy of who will win the games. \n",
    "    -The data from this year, while accurate, will not truly complete the dataset since they have not finished the season, they are about halfway through, and we will train our data on full seasons.  \n",
    "    -The it will also be difficult to get an actual accurate prediction of who will win games. It will be easy to predict who will make it to the playoffs, however predicting who will win will be much more difficult due to roster changes and in games tempo can easily sway.\n",
    "2. If the number of attributes is large, how will you explore feature selection techniques to pare down the attributes?\n",
    "    For this project we will attempt to sort out large numbers of attributes utilizing random forest and decision trees based upon the previous season of hockey.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Impact Of Results\n",
    "1. Why are the results useful?\n",
    " - The results of this project would be at its most basic form to predict what teams would currently make it into the stanley cup playoffs given their points and score. From there we want to take all the past champions and see who has won and their stats and figure out who would win the stanely cup given who made it in and their stats. Another plan for this project, but we are still mostly unsure how this will work is prediciting the outcomes of each series in the playoffs, figuring out who will win each series and by how much\n",
    "2. Who are the stakeholders?\n",
    " - The stake holders are people intrested in data, and the stanely cup. Another large stakeholder in this dataset would be gamblers and betting. if this dataset can become extremely accurate, betting on it could end up being very profitable, aside from an occasional upset, this would base it off of many stats, and build hopefully a fairly accurate prediction algorithm"
