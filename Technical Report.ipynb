    " The dataset we used for this project was an NHL league standings dataset, found [here](http://inalitic.com/datasets/nhl_leaguestandings_data.html), that contains the standings from every season since 1940. We added an extra column to correspond to positions within the playoffs. The dataset had a wealth of information and for our project we wanted to determine how well a team placed this within playoffs using a kNN classifier, a decision tree and a Random Forest. Out of these classifiers, the decision tree performed the best with our dataset and code. \n"

    "This is another simple pie plot that checks something important to our group, the amount of teams over the years that won, and utlizes our new atribue FINISH. This plot checks all the different teams that made it to finals and seperates them into won once or lost. This graph is more a confirmation then anything else and it does make sense. the msot interesting portion of this graph is that of the 46 teams, 30 have made it to finals in the past. Now while the playoffs have been going for years and the records start in 1940, having this many teams make it to finals is astounding."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The dataset we utlized was the nhl records. Our goal with this project was to create classifiers that are accurate in predicting a teams overall poistion in the playoffs. The dataset was missing a slight amount of information and an attribute for playoffs position however, this was corrected by our team. The classifiers we utilized were kNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Overall our classifiers performed decently, though not as well as we hoped. One of the challenges for the classification that we had was that our original decision tree was splitting on each percentage in the table individually. While this was not necessarily an issue it resulted in our decision tree splitting an enormous amount of times on a few instances and did not fit with the rest of our project, so it was changed to groupings of percentages.\n",
